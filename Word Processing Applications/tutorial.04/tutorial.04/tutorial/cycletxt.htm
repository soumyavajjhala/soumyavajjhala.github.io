            Hi fellow Cycle-Paths! The riding season is well 
            underway and I'm recovering from the 
            <em>Grand Mesa Century</em>, our first event
            of the summer tour schedule. Thanks to the
            volunteers who worked the relief and refreshment
            stations, and congratulations to all who finished.
         </p>
         <p>
            Our next club meeting is Tuesday, July 8th 
            at the DoubleTree Hotel in Grand Junction. 
            Kaylee Frieze will talk about the upcoming 
            <em>Gunnison Challenge</em> tour. Be sure to stay 
            afterward for refreshments and fun.
         </p>

               <h1>Riding the Rim</h1>
               <h2>&mdash; Kathy Rawlings</h2>
            </hgroup>
            <p>
               Rim Rock Drive in Colorado National Monument has 
               tested many of the world's strongest riders,
               but is still accessible to the weekend cyclist. If you 
               decide to <em>Tour the Moon</em>, here are some tips
               to help you have a great ride:
            </p>
            <ul>
               <li><strong>Keep Hydrated</strong> The canyon sun 
                    can quickly sap your energy. Make sure you carry 
                    plenty of water; there are no watering holes along 
                    the Rim.
               </li>
               <li><strong>Bring Lights</strong> All bikes must be 
                    equipped with front and rear lights for safe 
                    passage through the Rim's tunnels. Cyclists must 
                    use a white light visible at least 500 feet in 
                    front and a red light visible at least 200 feet 
                    from the rear.
               </li>
               <li><strong>Ride Single File</strong> Rim Rock Drive 
                    is narrow, with sheer drop-offs to the canyon valley.
                    Leave plenty of room for drivers to pass you and your
                    group.
               </li>
            </ul>
